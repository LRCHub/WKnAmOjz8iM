What a beautiful life away, naked from all the Apollonians
For their radiance shines on and on
When endowed with promises, majestic with all the stallions
But the fateful truth burns on and on

When in doubt you made me stay connected in with the beyond and on
Like when the radio plays on and on

So the earth would dry of song if I sang you one
Carry on! Carry on Phenomenon!
So you got the best of me so amazingly
Carry on! Carry on Phenomenon and on and on...

Oh the way that you waved to me, it awakened me in shock and awe
During the reigning age of Solomon and on and on
My nefarious state of mind illuminate in every song
For your serenade plays on and on...

So the earth would dry of song if I sang you one
Carry on! Carry on Phenomenon!
So you got the best of me so amazingly
Carry on! Carry on Phenomenon and on and on...

So the earth would dry of song if I sang you one
Carry on! Carry on Phenomenon!
So you got the best of me so amazingly
Carry on! Carry on Phenomenon and on and on...

So the earth would dry of song if I sang you one
Carry on! Carry on Phenomenon!
So you got the best of me so amazingly
Carry on! Carry on Phenomenon and on and on...
