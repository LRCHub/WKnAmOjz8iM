Turn around and meet the hater
Turn around and
Zombie, thirteen
Zombie, thirteen

Hell on earth
For what it's worth
Dead on dreaming
You started screaming

The wizard of how
The king of the now
Cry like a banshee
And die like you want me

Zombie, thirteen
Zombie, thirteen

Ow the conquering worm
The slithering germ
Lost in the black sleep
I see how the gods weep

The horror of madness
The terminal sadness
The cool air of mourning
Gave me the warning

I am zombie
Zombie, thirteen
Zombie, thirteen
Zombie
Thirteen

Turn around and get it on
Get it on
Get it on

Demonoid phenomenon
Get it out, get it on
Demonoid phenomenon
Get it out, get it on

Get it on
Get it on

Demonoid phenomenon
Get it out, get it on
Demonoid phenomenon
Get it out, get it on

Demonoid phenomenon
Get it out, get it on
